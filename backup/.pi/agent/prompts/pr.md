description: Prepare a PR title and description for this branch
---
Prepare a pull request for this branch.

1. Determine the merge base with the main branch and review all commits/diffs on it
2. Write a PR title: short imperative summary (`type(scope): ...` style)
3. Write a PR description:
   - **What** — what changed, bullet points
   - **Why** — motivation and context
   - **Testing** — how it was/was verified, including what wasn't tested
   - **Risks** — anything reviewers should look at closely
4. Do a self-review pass over the diff first: flag any leftover debug code, TODOs, or unintended changes

Output the title + description as markdown ready to paste into GitHub.
