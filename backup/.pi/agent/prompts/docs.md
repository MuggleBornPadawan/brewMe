Generate documentation for ${1:-the current git diff}.

1. For each exported/public function, class, or module: write or update a docstring/comment covering purpose, parameters, return value, side effects, and a usage example if non-trivial
2. Follow the existing doc style in this project (check neighboring files first)
3. Document *why*, not just *what* — skip trivial getters and self-evident code
4. If the project README or docs mention this area, check whether they need updating too and flag it

Don't add comments to obvious code — noise is worse than silence.
